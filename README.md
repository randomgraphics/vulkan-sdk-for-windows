This repository is a pre-installed Vulkan-SDK for Window platform. The purpose of this repository is to simplify Vulkan applications build process on Windows, especially when doing it with automated scripts.

Instead of downloading and running the Vulkan installer, it is much easier to simply include this project as submodule of yours, or check it out into a Windows container as dependencies.
